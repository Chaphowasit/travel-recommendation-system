                "Kin Dee (Eat Well) was recommended by my sister and we were not disappointed, and we too will continue to spread the word. \nThe restaurant is hidden down a rather small side road (All taxis seem to know where this place is located). Kin Dee itself is rather secluded and surrounded by greenery.\nThe rustic red brick building is pleasantly airy with open walls with beautiful orchids hanging everywhere. There is also no air conditioning but fans are scattered along the walls.\nThe food quality was delicious and filling and prices are beyond fair.\nThe welcoming atmosphere created by the three young lads, who did the most serving was impressive.\nKin Dee certainly lives up to it's name.\nOur only gripe is the restrooms, which are located down a steep slop and it's very difficult to navigate in the dark.\nWe returned again twice.",
                "This is our first time eating at Kin Dee Restaurant. Mr. Win provided genuinely amazing service. The cuisine was also excellent, but the mango salad and green curry particularly impressed us.",
                "Great authentic Thai food with quick service. The food came out very fast, and the service was excellent. Credit card payments are accepted, which is convenient. The only downside was the presence of mosquitoes and bugs.",
                "Kin Dee was absolutely superb. Definitely the best restaurant where we had dinner at whilst here in Phuket. Thank you, Tripadvisor for this suggestion.",
                "The restaurant serves super delicious food. Everything was top notch but sea food such as clams was particularly exquisite. The best fish in tamarind sauce I have ever tried in Thailand so far. Excellent service and atmosphere too. Spacious interior. Good selection of wine. Perfect place for dinner.",
                "Great food at a more authentic Thai restaurant. Staff and variety of food and drink is very good indeed. Not to mention the sensible prices compared to the hotel restaurants.",
                "We had a really delicious meal here. We were recommended thus restaurant by our hotel and it did not disappoint, we'd definitely recommend a visit if you like traditional Thai food.",
                "This restaurant is great not only for food but also has a very nice seating outside, full of orchids of different kinds. We were ordering delivery lunches from there - Staying at JW Marriott, it was much cheaper than to eat at the hotel. Delivery over 500 baht is for free, they deliver to you security gate, send the menu and confirm the bill over whatsapp. \nFinally we wanted to see the place itself as well, and we were not disappointed. Totally worth the taxi fare from the hotel - we went there for dinner two evenings - what an amazing food. The owner greeted us as \"old friends\" due to our lunch orders ;).",
                "5 out of 5 for the food and the service. The food was delicious and portions generous.  The winged bean salad was an excellent starter and the beef stir fry with chilli garlic and holy basil a perfect main course . Recommended if you are near Mai Khao .",
                "We were recommended this restaurant by several people. We went with the whole family and everybody was very impressed by the restaurant, the food and the service. This family run restaurant is spacious and very nicely decorated. The value for money is amazing and we have added it to our ¬®go to list¬®for all our upcoming Phuket holidays.",
                "Ordered delivery from Kin Dee as we usually did in all our previous meals. Some tips and observations:\n- delivery is free for orders more than 500baht. \n- delivery process to JW Marriott was very smooth. They ask for your last name and room number and know the suitable back gates. Before delivery they call to let you know that the food is on its way (in 5 mins)\n- pre-orders for a specific time is possible! We timed our evening meal for after the happy hours and late afternoon swim and pre-ordered it before. Piece of cake!\n- restaurant website is tricky. All of us kept trying to get to the website and online menu. The links all lead you elsewhere. I‚Äôve attached the menu as photos for reference. When all else fails, give them a call. \n- orders can be done on verbally or via WhatsApp. We used WA which allowed us to check the final order and bill before confirming it. \n\nWe love Kin Dee and I‚Äôm so happy to see the menu and physical restaurant expanding! A Mai Khao institution. ü•∞",
                "The food quality is outstanding and prices are very affordable. A must visit. If you‚Äôre staying at JW Marriott a return taxi is 500 THB. Well worth it.\nStrongly recommend the pork belly. üëåüèº",
                "We've ended up eating here three times in the last week...as we keep coming back for more!\nThe food is great tasting and great value too across the extensive Thai menu.\nThe staff are very friendly and efficiently go about their work looking after customers.\nIt was raining one evening and one of the staff came across the road from the restaurant with an umbrella to help keep me dry, which was a kind thing to do!\nCouldn't recommend the place more highly...probably going back for a fourth visit before our vacation is over too!",
                "Very well executed Thai food, fresh and reasonably priced. Slightly away from the main hotel area, this is great local food at an affordable price. Many vegetable based dishes as well fish and meat. Banana blossom salad was my favourite of the evening.",
                "Came here with my family 3 nights in a row. Fresh , favorable and hot (temperature hot) food. Friendly folks, attentive service  and great food - highly recommend"

                "The food here is excellent. I ordered a veggie meal with tofu. Usually I don‚Äôt line the  texture of tofu but this was cooked well. The price was excellent and the staff were really more and attentive. I would really recommend",
                "Great atmosphere with traditional look! \nHokkie noodles are basic dishes although those were the best I ever had! As well as Pak Ka Prao has a bit of chilli kick but tasted delicious. Really recommend to check this place out if you around told town.",
                "A great spot for lunch or dinner in old phuket town - very busy and therefore best to ring ahead and book a table. Sooo many options to choose from and all can be customised to your preference - including to be made vegetarian e.g. Tofu. \n\nWe are a family of 5 and ate here on our last day - saving the best till last! We all enjoyed our meal and thai tea / coffees! :)",
                "We had such a great lunch experience at this place. The historic elements & fact that this was family house converted into restaurant only adds to the overall authenticity of the restaurant, as if the great food was not enough. The food is a blend of Thai, Chinese Hokkien and Peranakan cuisine.\nWe enjoyed amazing massaman curry & pad thai, thai milk tea and blue butterfly pea ice tea. Regrettably, we did not try hokkien mee (noodles) which is their specialty.\nThe whole atmosphere & vibe is really great - it makes it a perfect pit stop on a hot day.\nThe staff is wonderful and super attentive.\nDon't miss it when you are in Old Phuket Town, it is truly a gem of a place.",
                "The food reflects a respect and an insistence of tradition, herbs, spices and long cooking time.   The waitresses were  also gracious and helpful.  \nThe drinks were also heartfully prepared, which is rare for a touristy district. \nFor us, this beats the Michelin Guide place we visited last night by a mile. \nTwo thumbs up for the combined experience of food, service, cleanliness, the entire experience and the value-for-money.",
                "We had the original noodle dish and i can taste the freshness of the ingredients but the flavor is nothing special as it‚Äôs a little mild for our taste.  The old phuket town where this restaurant is nice to check out and definitely worth the drive.",
                "The most amazing restaurant in Phuket town! We came here as many nights as we could and we‚Äôre only disappointed due to not realising they were shut on our final night - the Sunday night market night. Food was delicious and the staff were delightful!",
                "Situated in a very popular street in old Phuket town , great for old atmospheric ambience. Chinese dominated cuisine. Generous portions. Had char kuay tow , Pak mee Meng ( vegetarian) and local desert. \nFreshly prepared food , might have to wait as gets busy",
                "Lucky for us we happened on this delightful restaurant in the 1st week of our 6week stay on Phuket.We were staying in Surinbeach ( a good 45mins away)and visited at least 7/ 8 times..it was THAT good.\nNot only delicious local dishes..especially loved the Massaman and the crispy wintins with Salsa starter, but my favorite of all was the Lychee Mojito soda( only 65baht!!!)so beautiful and refreshing that often I had 2.\nThe staff are lovely, the history in the restaurant so intersting and the food delicious.The area is enchanting , very photogenic and well worth a visit.Highly recommend",
                "Great food for a very reasonable price. They have a large menu with plenty of good dishes and some very nice cold drinks. Staff were friendly as well, probably the nicest meal we had in Phuket.",
                "A Chinese-Thai restaurant in the heart of old Phuket on Thalang Road. The food here is amazing with delicious dishes I haven‚Äôt tasted elsewhere. The staff here are lovely and you can phone ahead and book a table. This is necessary as it is very popular.",
                "Food is good, try the Hockkien Mee. Service for after serving should improve. Takes too long. Also the ice coffee and black coffee is good.",
                "A very good restaurant . We had a dinner We had morning glory, pad met ma muang, Tom yam koong. Chicken Curri , Rice. Lichee drink.\nEvery dish was wonderful, delicious.\nWe will come again, the next time that we‚Äùll be in the area."

(Those of u who don‚Äôt like spice, don‚Äôt worry, they will make your food how u want it.) As I was eating my dinner, many people came to get a table here & the owner-manager was very gracious & helpful (& patient with all the tourists) as he gave them a number & approximate time to come back. Also note the bathroom was very clean & pretty. And my chocolate gelato was delicious & cooling! All around just a super experience for 400baht - awesome!! I think I‚Äôll go back again before I leave Kata Beach‚ù§Ô∏è\n                     \n\n                      More",

                "All staffs are unfriendly and ignorant to the customers. Don't see any smile from them at all and they keep chit chating with each other. The toast quality is also overrated. It's simply the toast with sugar and butter and nothing spectacular. Never return again",

Well, as the photo shows, they had boxes of the stuff on the prep counter.\n\nThe desserts were overall quite average. Which we had to enjoy on a rainy afternoon on the sidewalk.
